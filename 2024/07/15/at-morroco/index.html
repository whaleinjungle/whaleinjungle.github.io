I’m going to Morocco for first time"></a>00. I’m going to Morocco for first time</h4><p>This was a solo trip I haven’t done for a while. I wasn’t afraid despite there’s cautionary whispers about its suitability for an Asian girl traveling alone. But once you’ve figured out who you are and how do you want to live, the fear is off, life is just wonder and beauty. </p>
<p>So, with nothing but a book on Islamic architecture, some food tips from my friend Yassine, and a word “Shukran” — means “thank you” in Arabic, I landed in Tangier with absolutely zero plans. </p>
<p>Every moment was like stepping into a whole new world. Toothless guy wanted to hold my hand and take me home. People were into grass, even when it comes to water it in a human way. Football was everywhere, forget digital payments, and the traffic was a nightmare. Many of them at least can speak 3 languages, Arabic, Amazigh, and French. And that’s just scratching the surface.</p>
<h4 id="01-A-stranger-became-my-one-day-trip-partner"><a href="#01-A-stranger-became-my-one-day-trip-partner" class="headerlink" title="01. A stranger became my one-day trip partner"></a>01. A stranger became my one-day trip partner</h4><p>Au, a moroccan guy from Casablanca, can speak “a little” English, as he put it. He was also visiting Tangier without any plans. He decided to tag along with me, took only 3 seconds. Our journey together was quite interesful — interesting and useful. </p>
<p>He majored French literature in uni, showed a strong inner strength to be his authentic self in a relatively closed social context. We spent hours and hours talking about life, society, and women movements in Morocco, very interesting and inspiring. And thanks to him, I had a live map and a skilful translator. </p>
<p>His generosity knew no bounds. I was impressed. He’d give money to strangers like they were old pals from kindergarten. He’s been too nice to people, part of me thinking. </p>
<p>24 hours after our encounter, inspired by Su — an impressive traveler from London whom we met under a fig tree, he took me on his rented motorbike to chase the sunset at a beach half an hour away. It was really beautiful. </p>
<p>But it started to rain as we were heading back. </p>
<p>Rain poured down, under the darkness, casting an eerie atmosphere over our journey. My legs were frozen, phone almost dead, slippery roads, incredibly steep slopes, and our semi-functional motorbike. I know, sounds a recipe for disaster. And sure enough, it struck. We fell among passing cars. Yet amidst the chaos, his first concern was to check if I was ok, while he was the one pinned under the motorbike. Fortunately, we emerged unscathed, a stroke of luck in the face of potential catastrophe. </p>
<p>So we decided to munch a nice tagine for dinner to celebrate. </p>
<p>As we made our way to the restaurant, a moroccan guy showed up to guide. I knew he was for money, and I didn’t like that, people aiming for money pretending to help, plus we already had google maps on standby. I wanted to warn Au to keep away from him. I slowed my pace behind them, walking clueless and asking Au for directions. But he didn’t seem to catch on, just kept the guide aside until the money-asking part. It seemed 20 dirhams not enough for his 3-minute company. I walked off. When this was done, I mentioned to Au to watch out for those types. He said it’s ok, no big deal. </p>
<p>I was dimly unhappy. Thoughts swirled in my head: why did he fall for it? Why he didn’t listen to me? I was just trying to protect us. I stewed for 2 minutes. Then I knew how to regulate my emotions. What’s annoyed me was actually my desire to control by imposing my thoughts on others. Fortunately I’ve learnt how to deal with it and truly respect others, I leant it in a hard way though. So I released myself, had a very nice lamb Tagine wrapped in figs, prunes, and veggies. Happy and full. He had no idea how annoyed I was.           </p>
<p>He has a pure soul. It caught up on my mind at the midnight. An unexpected reflection came across. As a modern one, I’m armed to be discerning. I’m used to filtering out chaos that might harm or inconvenience me. He was not. He allowed himself to be hurt. He has an almost ignorant trust for others. He accepted to be fooled. We all know, it takes real courage and strong heart to be that way. He has a pure soul.    </p>
<h4 id="02-The-receptionist"><a href="#02-The-receptionist" class="headerlink" title="02. The receptionist"></a>02. The receptionist</h4><p>There’s a piano in the hotel. On a whim, I decided to play. The piano was absolutely untuned, plus my sophomore piano skills, let’s just say it wasn’t music to anyone’s ears.</p>
<p>As I hit the final key, the receptionist approached with a tray of mint tea(my fav!). To my surprise, she said that was really beautiful, thanked me for bringing the piano to life again.</p>
<p>Her words lingered in my mind. I hadn’t played well at all, yet she found beauty in it. You see how beautiful is the world when you see it with a gratitude.</p>
<h4 id="03-A-taxi-driver"><a href="#03-A-taxi-driver" class="headerlink" title="03. A taxi driver"></a>03. A taxi driver</h4><p>I got on a taxi to a bigger taxi station. Tough beginning. it started off on a somewhat tense note when my attempt at small talk was met with a firm ‘no’ from the driver. Undeterred, I settled into the journey.</p>
<p>Standing water on roads. We were driving slowly, really slowly, even though there were no cars around. Suddenly, our car got drenched by a much faster taxi. It obviously pissed off the driver. He promptly accelerated to catch up. Then he did it, honked at that car. </p>
<p>At that very moment, he turned to me, seeking acknowledgment for his pursuit of justice. I understood, and nodded clumsily in agreement. Recognising my support, he seemed satisfied. After arrival, I received a 5-star review.</p>
<h4 id="04-On-the-bus-to-Chefchaouen"><a href="#04-On-the-bus-to-Chefchaouen" class="headerlink" title="04. On the bus to Chefchaouen"></a>04. On the bus to Chefchaouen</h4><p>Somehow, I found myself boarding a bus which only the locals takes — the tourist version directed another station with 3 times higher price than this one. </p>
<p>The scene inside the bus reminded me of China 20 years ago. Half broken seats. Garden of dusts, perpetual noise, kids crying, and even someone peddling socks. I sighed, realising I had no entertainment to distract me, no earphones, no books, low battery and even no google maps. This gonna be the longest 2 hours of my life, I thought.</p>
<p>Bus stopped again, a policeman boarded. Panic set in as passengers began presenting their IDs. I hadn’t brought mine along, opting to leave them in the hotel for safekeeping in case of robbery. My mind raced with worries—how would I explain this to the policeman? Would my ID photos suffice? Where would they take me if I couldn’t provide identification? </p>
<p>My heart pounded as the officer approached me.</p>
<p>He looked at me, smiled at me, said ¨welcome” to me. </p>
<p>Wordless. I could only manage a heartfelt thank you, deeply touched. </p>
<h4 id="05-The-bus-driver-who-knew-AliExpress"><a href="#05-The-bus-driver-who-knew-AliExpress" class="headerlink" title="05. The bus driver who knew AliExpress"></a>05. The bus driver who knew AliExpress</h4><p>The need to relieve myself struck while I was on the bus. Drawing from past experiences, I assumed the bus driver would stop at some bushes for me. He didn’t. When I asked him in English, trying to use a translator, I was surprised to find out that he spoke English. With a smile, he asked me where I was from and even mentioned knowing about AliExpress and Alipay. </p>
<p>And then he dropped me off at a restaurant. The whole bus was waiting for me. I thanked him upon arrival. He smiled and gave me his number, insisting that I could reach out to him anytime I needed help. Though I felt a twinge of guilt for inconveniencing the other passengers, it was overshadowed by a sense of warmth and gratitude for the care shown to me by these strangers.</p>
<h4 id="06-A-lady-next-to-me"><a href="#06-A-lady-next-to-me" class="headerlink" title="06. A lady next to me"></a>06. A lady next to me</h4><p>On the bus back to Tangier, I was dozing off after a hectic day. A moroccan lady asked if she could take the seat next to me. Of course yes. She settled into her seat, pulled out a pack of pipas—sunflower seeds. It transported me back to china 20 years ago again, these snacks looked just like the ones sold on street stands. Nutrition levels didn’t seem to matter much, flavour was king. So I glanced at it. She noticed swiftly, and her hand extended towards me, offering a handful, allowing me to take as many as I wanted.</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell how I felt. So I cried. </p>
<p>It wasn’t just the generosity of a mankind. Having an anticipation about the hardships faced by women in this part of the world, blinded me to the truth—they are real. They are real people instead of a symbol of sufferings. </p>
<p>I wished I could speak Arabic so that could talk to her, to know more about her, like her friends would. Language held immense importance. But it’s not everything. We shared a connection beyond words. Simply by sitting beside each other, we understood the authenticity of ourselves and our place in the world, in our little way.</p>
<h4 id="07-A-heart-broken-man"><a href="#07-A-heart-broken-man" class="headerlink" title="07. A heart-broken man"></a>07. A heart-broken man</h4><p>As I made my way to the airport on the final day of my trip, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of contentment and fulfilment. Loved this trip, grateful for what happened. happiness had effortlessly found its way onto my face. </p>
<p>In that moment, a man on his bike passed by, and our eyes met briefly. I smiled with kindness. </p>
<p>But it seemed he took it in another way. He began to follow me, keeping a distance of about 20 minutes as I made my way to the station. Each time I glanced back to check for traffic, he would quickly duck behind his bike, as if trying to remain unnoticed.</p>
<p>I live streamed this to my friend Pa by texting. She perceived it dimly spooky. I get that—in our social context, this apparently is stalking, or malicious intent. But I kinda get that too—in his eyes, he might think he finally found his soul mate, true love, the woman he’s gonna marry with, then have many kids.</p>
<p>Things were not like that. He left on his bike with a broken heart.</p>
